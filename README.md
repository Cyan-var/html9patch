>**Note:** A normal PNG file (*.png) will be loaded with an empty one-pixel border added around the image, in which you can draw the stretchable patches and content area. A previously saved NinePatch file (*.9.png) will be loaded as-is, with no drawing area added, because it already exists.

Optional controls include:
* **<b>Zoom:** Adjust the zoom level of the graphic in the drawing area.
* **Patch scale:** Adjust the scale of the images in the preview area.
* **Show lock:** Visualize the non-drawable area of the graphic on mouse-over.
* **Show patches:** Preview the stretchable patches in the drawing area (pink is a stretchable patch).
* **Show content:** Highlight the content area in the preview images (purple is the area in which content is allowed).
* **Show bad patches:** Adds a red border around patch areas that may produce artifacts in the graphic when stretched. Visual coherence of your stretched image will be maintained if you eliminate all bad patches.

> **Warning:** If you need a compatible Internet Explorer 9 or less, 9-Patch above and left of the cutting area use 1px.
